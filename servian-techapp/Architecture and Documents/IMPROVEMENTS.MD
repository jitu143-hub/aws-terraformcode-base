Below are the couple of things can be added to solution
1. Jenkins on Kubernetes to build the image (It was not done as more of deployment was asked)
2. sonarqube can be added to CI in jenkins pipeline
3. We need to unseal vault manually now we can add role with KMSkey which has unseal token.
4. In helm chart instead of adding values manually we can use set to pass the values(This is not implemented in couple of modules)
5. AWS modules can be pushed to another repo and source can be git path of that repo
6. We can add monitoring tools like grafana and promothesus and alerting tool like pagerduty
7. In deployment.yaml we can make use of vault to pull the credentials right now it is done as secret
8. WAF can be implemented with regex pattern default rules provided by aws to avoid http attack etc.
